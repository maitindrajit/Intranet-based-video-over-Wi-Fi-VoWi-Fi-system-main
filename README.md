Intranet based video over Wi-Fi VoWi-Fi system main


Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple video calling application using socket programming in Java. The application connects two PCs within an intranet using their IP addresses to facilitate real-time video communication. The key components of the project include capturing video from a webcam, streaming the video data over a network socket, and displaying the received video stream.

Features
Real-time video calling between two PCs over an intranet.
Utilizes socket programming for network communication.
Captures and streams video data from a webcam.
Decodes and displays the received video stream.

Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
Webcam for video capture
PCs connected within the same intranet
IP addresses of the participating PCs  

Notes
Ensure both PCs have the same version of Java and necessary dependencies installed.
The application may require network configurations like port forwarding if running on different subnets.
This project is a basic implementation for educational purposes and may need enhancements for production use, such as handling network latency and optimizing video quality.
